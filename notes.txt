How are we going to make a function... 

We need to recognize parameters, and substitution... 
Quite literally, a function is a tree. 

The tree has placeholders for variables. 

The variables are then subbed in when the function is called. 

The function is then evaluated. 


Our current tree must allow for these placeholders... 
but how? 

We're not evaluating the tree... 

Generate a symbol table. Try to pull from it 
before pulling from the general table. 

So, we make a function symbol table, and then... 
go on our way.
